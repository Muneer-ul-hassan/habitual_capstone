# Habitual: Build Lasting Habits â€” CS50W Capstone Project

Habitual is a privacy-first web application designed to help users create, track, and maintain lasting habits through a dynamic and interactive platform. Unlike simple habit trackers, Habitual integrates mood tracking, streak-based gamification, and data-driven insights to motivate users toward positive lifestyle changes. It uses Django as the backend framework to store user data, habits, mood logs, and reminders in models, while JavaScript on the frontend powers dynamic charts, interactive UI elements, notifications, and responsive design.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

Habitual is distinct from the other projects in the CS50W curriculum. It is not a social network, an e-commerce platform, or a simple content-delivery site. Instead, it is a personal productivity tool that focuses on user engagement and data visualization. The complexity of the project lies in the following features:

*   **Mood Tracking and Correlation:** Users can log their daily mood, and the application will visualize the correlation between their mood and habit completion. This provides users with valuable insights into their well-being.
*   **Gamification:** The application includes a streak calculation system and a badge system to gamify the habit-tracking process and keep users motivated.
*   **Time-Zone-Aware Reminders:** Users can set reminders for their habits, and the application will send them notifications at the correct time in their local timezone.
*   **Data Export:** Users can export their habit and mood data as a CSV file for their own personal use.
*   **Interactive Charts:** The application uses Chart.js to create interactive charts that visualize habit completion trends and mood correlations.
*   **Dynamic UI:** The application uses AJAX to update the UI without requiring a page reload, creating a smooth and responsive user experience.
